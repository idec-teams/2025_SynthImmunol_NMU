                    <p>RFDiffusion is a cutting-edge method for de novo protein structure and function design,
                      leveraging the capabilities of deep learning and diffusion models. It is based on the RoseTTAFold
                      (RF) structure prediction network, fine-tuned on protein structure denoising tasks. The principle
                      behind RFDiffusion is to generate protein backbones by iteratively refining noise-corrupted
                      structures, eventually producing functional and structurally accurate proteins from simple
                      molecular specifications.</p>

                    <p>HDOCK server is a free docking framework based on hybrid docking strategy, which automatically
                      incorporate the binding interface information into traditional global docking, and realize the
                      sampling and scoring of protein and protein docking with robustness and high speed. Although
                      developers claim that HDOCK can realize the docking between protein and nucleic acid, it is still
                      difficult because of the complexity and flexibility of nucleic acid structure. HDOCK server
                      integrates homology search, template-based modeling, structure prediction, global docking,
                      biological information integration and job management, and supports downloading and visual
                      interaction, so it is friendly to non-professional biologist.</p>
                    <p>AlphaFold3 is a state-of-the-art protein structure prediction tool developed by DeepMind. It
                      utilizes deep learning techniques to quickly and accurately predict the three-dimensional
                      structure of proteins based on their amino acid sequences. This advanced AI system has
                      significantly improved the speed and accuracy of protein structure predictions, making it a
                      valuable resource for biological research, drug discovery, and understanding the functions of
                      proteins in the body. AlphaFold3 builds upon the success of its predecessors, offering a more
                      efficient and reliable way to predict protein structures, which can aid in the development of new
                      therapeutics and deepen our understanding of biological systems.</p>

                      <li>Data input</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The HDOCK web server is available at <a href=http://hdock.phys.hust.edu.cn/ target=_blank
                        rel=noopener>http://hdock.phys.hust.edu.cn/</a>. Both sequence and structure information of
                      ligand and receptor should be uploaded through the website separately. The docking process will be
                      carried out in the server. Click submit to wait for the results. Generally, the waiting time is
                      approximately 30 minutes. The submitted sequences should be in FASTA format and contain only
                      standard amino acids. The structure should be in PDB format. In addition, residue information of
                      the binding sitei is also possible to be submitted as a filter in the docking process.</p>
                    <ol start=2>
                      <li>Docking preparation</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>First, the homologous sequences of molecules will be searched by sequence similarity search. The
                      template with the highest sequence coverage, highest sequence similarity and highest resolution
                      will be selected to build the template-based model. ClustalW is used for sequence alignment, and
                      MODELLER is used for model construction. This step will be executed on the server.</p>
                    <ol start=3>
                      <li>Global docking</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>HDOCKlite, a layered docking program based on FFT, is used to globally sample the presumed
                      binding directions. If the binding site information was provided when submitting, the docking
                      process will also include it. The ranked binding modes are clustered with an RMSD cutoff of 5 Å.
                      if two binding modes have a ligand RMSD of ≤ 5 Å, the one with the better score is kept. This step
                      will be executed on the server. The docking model of HDOCKlite and the template-based docking
                      model of MODELLER will be provided for download through web interaction.</p>
                    <ol start=4>
                      <li>Results analysis</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The server will send the top 10 docking models to the website. The results page contains an
                      interactive visualization window and a summary table. The summary table usually contains docking
                      energy score, confidence score and ligand RMSD. If the SAXS data file is provided, the SAXS
                      chi-square of the model can also be displayed. Results can also be downloaded as a PDB file, using
                      the molecular visualization software PyMOL to open and view the predicted model.</p>
                    <p>C. AlphaFold3</p>

                      <li>Data Retrieval</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>① Retrieve Template Structures: The model retrieves template structures from PDBmmCIF files. This
                      involves parsing the files to extract the relevant structural information that can serve as a
                      template for the prediction of the target protein structure.</p>
                    <p>② Database Sequence Retrieval: Retrieve protein sequences from five databases to be used for
                      multiple sequence alignment (MSA). And retrieve RNA sequences from three databases, also for MSA
                      purposes. These sequences help in understanding the evolutionary context and the potential
                      interactions with the protein of interest.</p>
                    <ol start=2>
                      <li>Sequence and Token Processing</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>① Tokenization: Convert the input sequences (protein and RNA), ligands, and covalent bonds into
                      tokens. Tokenization is the process of breaking the sequences into smaller units that can be
                      processed by the neural network.</p>
                    <p>② Embedding: Input the tokens into an embedder, which is a component of the neural network
                      designed to convert tokens into high-dimensional vectors (embeddings) that capture their meaning
                      in the context of the model. The embedder will output three types of embeddings:</p>
                    <p>Input Embeddings: Representations of the input sequences.</p>
                    <p>Single Embeddings: Representations of individual tokens.</p>
                    <p>Pair Embeddings: Representations of pairs of tokens, which capture the relationships between
                      different parts of the sequences.</p>
                    <ol start=3>
                      <li>Structure Generation and Refinement</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>① Integration of Information: Combine the template structure information with the pair embeddings
                      obtained from the feature extraction module. Integrate MSA information to generate a pair
                      representation that captures the evolutionary and structural relationships within the sequences.
                    </p>
                    <p>② Representation Regulation: Use the Pairformer module to organize and update the single
                      representation and pair representation information. This module ensures that the relationships
                      between different parts of the protein are accurately reflected in the model&rsquo;s
                      representations. And the single and pair representations are updated iteratively through multiple
                      cycles to refine and improve their accuracy.</p>
                    <p>③ Structure Prediction: Pass the encoded information through a diffusion model, which
                      progressively adds noise to the data and then denoises it to generate a clear three-dimensional
                      structure of the protein. Then use metrics such as pLDDT (predicted local distance difference
                      testing), PAE (predicted alignment error), and PDE (predicted distance error) to assess the
                      confidence of the predicted structure. These metrics provide insight into the quality and
                      reliability of the predicted protein structure.</p>

                    <p>ClonExpress technology is a simple, fast and efficient technique for seamless DNA cloning,
                      allowing targeted cloning of insert fragments into any site of any vector. The vector is
                      linearized by introducing the terminal sequence of the linearized vector at the 5&rsquo; end of
                      the forward/reverse PCR primer of the insert, so that the 5&rsquo; and 3&rsquo; ends of the PCR
                      product have the same sequence (15 - 20 bp) as the two ends of the linearized vector,
                      respectively. After the PCR product and linearized vector were mixed in a certain proportion, the
                      reaction can be carried out at 37℃ for 30 min under the catalysis of recombinase to complete the
                      targeted cloning.</p>

                    <p><strong>A. Vector linearization:</strong> The linearized vector was obtained via restriction
                      enzyme digestion or inverse PCR.</p>
                    <p><strong>B. Insert fragment acquisition:</strong> Homologous sequences corresponding to the 15-20
                      bp terminal regions of the linearized vector were added to the 5&rsquo; ends of the gene-specific
                      forward/reverse amplification primers. The insert fragment containing homologous arms was
                      amplified using these primers.</p>
                    <p><strong>C. Recombination reaction:</strong> The linearized vector and insert fragment were mixed
                      at an optimal ratio, followed by a 5-30 minutes recombination reaction catalyzed by Exnase (2×CE
                      Mix) at 50°C to achieve in vitro circularization of the multiple linear DNA fragments.</p>
                    <p><strong>D. Transformation of competent cells:</strong> The recombinant products were directly
                      transformed into competent cells, yielding hundreds of single colonies on agar plates for
                      subsequent positive screening.</p>

                          downstream of the cloning site are preferentially selected.</p>

                      <li>
                        <p><strong>General primer design principles:</strong> Homologous sequences corresponding to the
                          termini of the linearized vector are introduced at the 5’-ends of the forward and reverse
                          amplification primers for the insert fragment. This ensures that the amplified insert fragment
                          contains terminal homologous sequences at its 5’ and 3’ ends that match the corresponding
                          sequences of the linearized vector.
                          Forward primer design: 5’–[Homologous sequence from upstream vector terminus] + [Restriction
                          site (retained or removed)] + [Gene-specific forward primer sequence]–3’.
                          Reverse primer design: 5’–[Homologous sequence from downstream vector terminus] + [Restriction

                      <li>
                        <p><strong>PCR amplification of insert fragment:</strong> The insert fragment is amplified using
                          any PCR polymerase, with no requirement to consider the presence or absence of A-overhangs at
                          the product termini.</p>

                    <p>Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI) is a label-free technology that converts the optical interference
                      signals generated on the surface of a BLI biosensor into real-time response signals. By monitoring
                      the molecular binding process in real time, the system measures the association constant (ka or
                      kon), dissociation constant (kd or koff), and initial binding rate, and further derives affinity
                      (KD) and concentration information through fitting and computational analysis.</p>
                    <p>Octet biosensors are constructed from glass optical fibers, with an additional specialized
                      optical layer applied to the distal end. This optical layer provides a surface chemistry matrix
                      for ligand immobilization. White light, encompassing all wavelengths within the visible spectrum,
                      is introduced into the optical fiber and undergoes partial internal reflection at two interfaces:
                      the interface between the glass fiber and the optical layer (which is fixed), and the interface
                      between the surface chemistry and the solution (which is variable). The two beams of reflected
                      light from these interfaces create an interference phenomenon. The instrument measures and records
                      the intensity of the interfering light at each wavelength, generating an interference spectrum.
                      Wavelengths that undergo constructive interference appear as peaks (high amplitude) on the
                      spectrum, while those experiencing destructive interference appear as valleys (low amplitude). The
                      Octet interaction analyzer detects molecular interactions by measuring changes in this
                      interference spectrum in real time.</p>
                    <p>When molecules bind to the ligand immobilized on the biosensor surface, the thickness of the
                      optical layer increases, resulting in a longer path length for the second reflected beam. This
                      causes a shift in the interference spectrum towards longer wavelengths (a rightward shift).
                      Conversely, when molecules dissociate from the ligand into the solution, the interference spectrum
                      shifts back towards shorter wavelengths (a leftward shift). A plot of the shift in the
                      interference spectrum (in nanometers) versus the time of the reaction is known as a Sensorgram.
                      Based on the Sensorgram, the values of ka, kd, and KD can be determined by fitting the data to
                      various binding models.</p>

                    <p><strong>A. Sensor pre-humidification:</strong> Pre-wet plates were placed in a blue chassis
                      (corner A1 of the sample plate needed to be snapped into the snap hole of the blue tray), and 200
                      μL of analytical buffer, such as PBST buffer and MES buffer, was added to the well where the
                      sensor was placed. The sensor was placed on the green disk, and then the green disk was snapped
                      onto the blue disk. The sensor needed to be pre-wetted for over 10 minutes.</p>
                    <p><strong>B. Methods Edit:</strong> Within the Experiment Wizard software, the &ldquo;New Kinetics
                      Experiment-Basic Kinetics&rdquo; option was selected. Following this, the protocol setup interface
                      was accessed. The Basic Kinetics Experiment window was maximized, and the following five steps
                      were sequentially edited:</p>
                    <p><strong>1. Plate Definition:</strong> In the Plate Definition setup, four sample columns were
                      designated as follows: Buffer1 was assigned to the baseline1 step, Load to the loading step,
                      Buffer2 to both the baseline2 and dissociation steps, and Sample to the association step. The
                      samples consisted of different test sequences at identical concentrations, with each well being
                      loaded with 200 μg/L of the respective sample. Following the completion of parameter
                      configuration, the experiment was initiated.</p>
                    <p><strong>2. Assay definition:</strong> In the assay definition, the setup steps were followed by
                      first clicking &ldquo;Add&rdquo; in the window to include the required analysis steps and set the
                      duration for each one. The following steps were added: Baseline (60 s), Loading (120 s), Baseline2
                      (120 s), Association (180 s), and Dissociation (180 s), after which &ldquo;OK&rdquo; was clicked
                      to confirm the selections. If any parameter required modification, it was edited by
                      double-clicking. Next, in the &ldquo;Step Data List,&rdquo; the Baseline step was clicked, the
                      arrow was moved to Baseline to indicate that the detection position for this step on the sample
                      plate would be configured, and then the first column of samples on the sample plate was
                      double-clicked, so that at the start of the experiment, the Baseline step would be detected using
                      the samples in the first column (buffer). The &ldquo;Assay Steps List&rdquo; then displayed the
                      first added step, showing that the Baseline analysis was performed using samples from the first
                      column, with &ldquo;No&rdquo; indicating the step number, &ldquo;Sample&rdquo; representing the
                      analysis location on the sample plate, and &ldquo;Sensor Type&rdquo; specifying the sensor
                      selected for analysis. This process was repeated to complete the experimental setup for the entire
                      kinetic analysis.</p>
                    <p><strong>3. Sensor assignment:</strong> In the sensor assignment, the sensor position was
                      configured.</p>
                    <p><strong>4. Review Experiment:</strong> Clicking the buttons allowed browsing the previous or next
                      step of the experiment respectively, enabling preview and verification of all experimental steps.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>5. Run Experiment:</strong> After the setup was completed, the &ldquo;Start
                      Experiment&rdquo; button was clicked. Before the experiment was initiated, it was ensured that the
                      samples and sensors were properly placed and the instrument door was securely closed.</p>
                    <p><strong>C. Result Analysis:</strong> The related data were acquired and processed using the data
                      analysis software of the Octet system. Through this analysis, sensor grams were generated, from
                      which kinetic parameters including KD, Kon, Koff, and steady-state fitting curves were derived.
                      The consistency between the fitted and measured curves was evaluated. If the fitted curve showed
                      strong agreement with the experimental curve, it indicated high quality of the fitting results.
                      Based on these data, a comprehensive assessment of the binding affinity between the test sequences
                      and the receptor was performed.</p>

                    <p>The action of lactate dehydrogenase resulted in the reduction of NAD+ to form NADH. Subsequently,
                      the combination of NADH and INT (2-p-iodophenyl-3-nitrophenyl tetrazolium chloride) was catalyzed
                      by thioctylamine dehydrogenase (diaphorase) to form NAD+ and formazan. This process produced an

                    <p>The cytotoxicity function of CAR-NK cells was assessed by co-culture tumor cells at an E:T
                      (effector to target) ratio of 1:1. For lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), CytoTox96 cytotoxicity assay
                      was used according to the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions (Promega, G1780).</p>
                    <p>Cytotoxicity (%) = [LDHE:T -LDHE]/LDHMax × 100%</p>
